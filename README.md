## About Me

I'm a software engineer in the New York City area that's been developing web applications as a personal interest for 20+ years. In an effort to finally make it my professional career, I recently completed a full-stack development bootcamp at <a href='http://www.fullstackacademy.com' target='_blank'>Fullstack Academy</a>.
